# SatelliteTrajectoryPlotter

Hello! This script is written by me as a way to solve a laboratory work given to me in university. 
The initial data is taken from a PDF supplied by my university and is located in this repository for your reference.
Based on that PDF, I wrote this script to solve for the values given in Variant 1.

Main idea - This script constructs the route taken by a satellite orbiting the Earth, in both 2D and 3D, given the initial position coordinates, velocity measurements and time

- This script is divided into three parts :
	- Determination of the satellite's orbital elements
	- Predicting the position and speed of the satellite at a given time
	- Construction of the route of the satellite orbiting the Earth

- Script name : lab1_me.py

- Variant : 1
